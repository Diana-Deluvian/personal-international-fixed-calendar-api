# My personal Calendar

While this project is still in it's experimental phase (nothing should be taken for granted), this is my attempt to address the issues with the Gregorian Calendar and actually create a functional, sensible calendar. It is based on the [international fixed calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar) with the most notable difference being that it starts on the 22nd of december rather than the first of january. The reason for this is that (in my subjective opinion), years should start on a meaningful, measurable day. The 21st of december is (usually) when the winter solstice occurs, and the days gain in lenght once more after it. A very fitting start of the year in my estimation.

Some other modifications I've made are give each month a unique name (presently in English, but subject to change), as well as every coming year, and ultimately the days as well. Naming of years is done to better reflect my personal feelings, and naming of days is done so you can have a direct, concrete reference to any point of the year that is also meaningful on a daily level (e.g. currently you can refer to the 17th of May quite easily, but you have no idea if it's a tuesday or not). 

The official starting point of the calendar is the 21st of December, 2021, which marks my step from 'the before times' to the New Era. 

(Please keep in mind that this project is mostly done for fun / to scratch an itch, it's very difficulty to disentangle oneself truly from the sway of the Gregorian Calendar, many desire it, and many have tried and failed)
